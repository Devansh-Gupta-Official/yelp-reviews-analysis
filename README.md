# Yelp Reviews Analysis

## Problem Statement
- In this project, Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies will be used to analyze Yelp reviews data
- Number of 'stars' indicate the business rating given by a customer, ranging from 1 to 5
- 'Cool', 'Useful' and 'Funny' indicate the number of cool votes given by other Yelp Users. 


## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook analyzes Yelp reviews using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, and Scikit-learn. The analysis includes data visualization, text preprocessing (removing punctuation, stopwords), and implementing a Naive Bayes classifier.

## Contents
**1. Importing Libraries and Dataset**
- Libraries: The notebook starts by importing essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NLTK.
- Dataset: It loads the Yelp dataset ('yelp.csv') into a Pandas DataFrame (df) to begin the analysis.

**2. Visualizing the Dataset**
- Data Overview: Describes the dataset structure, columns, and data types (df.info() and df.describe()).
- Text Length Distribution: Visualizes the distribution of review text lengths through histograms and statistical summary (df['length'].describe()).
- Review Analysis by Star Rating: Examines the distribution of reviews across different star ratings using count plots and histograms.

**3. Creating Testing and Training Dataset**
- Text Preprocessing: Demonstrates techniques for text preprocessing, including punctuation removal and stopwords elimination using NLTK.
- Count Vectorizer: Illustrates the process of converting text data into numerical format (bag-of-words) using Scikit-learn's CountVectorizer.

**4. Training the Model**
- Naive Bayes Classifier: Implements a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier using Scikit-learn to train the model on the preprocessed Yelp reviews.

**5. Evaluating the Model**
- Model Performance: Evaluates the trained model's performance metrics, including confusion matrices and classification reports for both training and test datasets.

**6. Additional Feature: TF-IDF**
- TF-IDF Transformation: Introduces Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency as an enhancement to feature representation for text data.
- Model Refitting: Retrains the model using TF-IDF transformed data and evaluates its performance.

## Usage
**1. Understanding the Dataset**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This notebook serves as a guide for users to comprehend the structure, attributes, and content of the Yelp dataset. It helps users gain insights into the nature of reviews, their lengths, and distributions across different star ratings.

**2. Text Preprocessing Techniques**
- Data Preparation: The notebook demonstrates preprocessing steps essential for handling text data. Users can learn how to clean text by removing punctuation and stopwords, crucial for further analysis or modeling.

**3. Building a Sentiment Analysis Model**
- Machine Learning Implementation: The primary focus is on showcasing the process of building a sentiment analysis model using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. Users can follow step-by-step instructions on preparing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

**4. Model Evaluation and Enhancement**
- Performance Assessment: Users can understand how to evaluate the effectiveness of the model using metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy. This evaluation aids in understanding the model's predictive capabilities and limitations.
- Feature Enhancement: Additionally, the notebook introduces TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) as an alternative feature representation method to potentially improve model performance.

**5. Learning from Examples**
- Demonstration and Replication: Through the provided examples and code snippets, users can replicate the analysis, modify parameters, or extend the methodology to suit different datasets or analysis goals.

**6. Educational Resource**
- Learning Tool: This notebook serves as an educational resource for individuals interested in:
- Text data preprocessing techniques.
- Implementing machine learning models for sentiment analysis.
- Evaluating model performance and understanding confusion matrices and classification reports.
